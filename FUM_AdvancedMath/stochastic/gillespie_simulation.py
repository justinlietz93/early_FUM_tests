    Performs a Gillespie simulation (Stochastic Simulation Algorithm).

    Parameters
    ----------
    initial_state : np.ndarray
        A 1D numpy array of the initial counts of each species.
    propensity_func : Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray]
        A function that takes the current state and returns the propensities
        (reaction rates) for each reaction.
    stoichiometry : np.ndarray
        A 2D numpy array of shape (n_reactions, n_species) that defines the
        change in species counts for each reaction.
    t_max : float
        The maximum simulation time.

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]
        A tuple containing:
        - The time points of the simulation.
        - The state of the system at each time point.
