    Calculates a proxy for Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels,
    which can be used to trigger structural plasticity.

    This proxy is based on the principle that correlated, rewarded activity
    promotes structural growth.

    Parameters
    ----------
    spike_times_pre : np.ndarray
        Spike times of the pre-synaptic neuron.
    spike_times_post : np.ndarray
        Spike times of the post-synaptic neuron.
    rewards : np.ndarray
        An array of reward signals, aligned with the spike times.
    time_window : float, optional
        The time window (in ms) to consider for correlated activity, by default 50.0.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The calculated BDNF proxy value.
