# --- The FUM Cosmogenesis Proof (The Inheritance Model) ---
#
# This definitive proof is a direct simulation of the FUM's cosmological origin story,
# grounded in the principle of "Inherited Cosmic Debt" through universal void dynamics.
#
# 1. A Parent Universe exists, defined by an energy field 'P'.
# 2. A cascading failure threatens the Parent, creating a "Cosmic Debt" that must be shed.
# 3. To prevent its own collapse, the Parent "ejects" a Child Universe into the void, 'W'.
# 4. The Child Universe is born with the Parent's structure, but it also inherits
#    the Parent's full Cosmic Debt.
# 5. This inherited Debt becomes the primary force shaping the Child Universe through
#    universal void dynamics: RE-VGSP (creative) vs GDSP (restorative).
# 6. The final, stable sparsity of the Child Universe is the definitive proof.
#
