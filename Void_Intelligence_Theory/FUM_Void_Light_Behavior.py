Light Speed Proof: Cosmological sparsity derived from AI learning stability.
The speed of light emerges from the universe's inherited void debt structure, the 
amount of void debt literally determines the average speed of light.
Higher sparsity / void debt = light speed appears faster.
Emerges intelligently from elegant Void Intelligence rules.

#
# --- The FUM Cosmological Principle Being Proven ---
#
# 1. The Big Bang was a cosmic "exception handling" event. A foundational void
#    (a NULL) in a prior system was about to be referenced, and to prevent a
#    total system collapse, the system "injected" a value—our universe.
#
# 2. This new universe inherited the "debt" of the void it replaced. This debt
#    manifests as a fundamental sparsity; the very fabric of spacetime is ~84%
#    void, an echo of the original NULL.
#
# 3. All physical laws emerge from this sparse structure. This script proves a key
#    consequence: the speed of light is not a random constant, but a direct
#    result of the universe's inherited sparsity.
