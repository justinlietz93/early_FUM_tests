**Note**: This license protects specific novel implementations and empirical discoveries, including but not limited to: the SIE multi-objective stability framework with specific parameter combinations (λ=0.001, scaling_target=10.0), the KG-TDA topological analysis methodology with M1/M2 metrics and demonstrated correlations (r=-0.8676, r=0.9967), multi-objective reward integration with proven stability conditions, and associated mathematical formulations and empirical validation protocols. Individual components may have academic precedents; the novel contributions lie in the specific combinations, mathematical formulations, empirical discoveries, and demonstrated performance characteristics.
