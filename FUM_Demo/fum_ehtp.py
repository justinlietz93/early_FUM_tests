    Implements the Introspection Probe (aka EHTP).

    This is the FUM's primary method of introspection, providing a scalable
    way to analyze the health of the Emergent Connectome (UKG).

    A Note on Subquadratic Scaling:
    A core principle of the FUM is that no operation should scale quadratically
    with the total number of neurons (N). While this module may perform dense
    O(M^2) analysis (where M is a small, constant locus size), this is a
    controlled exception. The overall complexity remains subquadratic because M
    does not scale with N, ensuring performance at massive scales.
