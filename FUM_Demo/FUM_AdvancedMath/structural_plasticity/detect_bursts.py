    Detects bursts of spikes in a spike train.

    A burst is defined as a sequence of spikes where the inter-spike interval
    is less than or equal to max_interspike_interval.

    Parameters
    ----------
    spike_times : np.ndarray
        A 1D numpy array of spike times.
    max_interspike_interval : float, optional
        The maximum time between spikes to be considered part of a burst, 
        by default 10.0.
    min_spikes_in_burst : int, optional
        The minimum number of spikes required to form a burst, by default 3.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        An array of the start and end times of the detected bursts.
