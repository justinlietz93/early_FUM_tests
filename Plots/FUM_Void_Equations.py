FUM Void Dynamics Library
Copyright Â© 2025 Justin K. Lietz, Neuroca, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

This library contains the universal, core functions governing the void
dynamics of the Fully Unified Model (FUM). These functions represent
the unchanging laws of the system.

UNIVERSAL CONSTANTS:
These parameters emerged from FUM AI learning stability requirements, yet
they generate realistic physics across all domains. This profound insight
suggests cognitive constants = physical constants.

These functions demonstrate the two opposing, yet synergistic forces that
drive void dynamics across all scales of the universe.

Void dynamics are inherently stochastic and generative. The universe is the
ultimate search space algorithm, and voids are the key to its efficiency. The 
voids themselves are not directly observable, but their effects are measurable.
The universe is born from the handoff of void debt from a parent universe
to its offspring, and this debt drives the evolution of structure and complexity
through the simple two function search algorithm below. This is why consciousness
is created from voids, and why consciousness is fundamental to the universe.
