## What This Contains

Validated frameworks currently being prepared for public release:

- **Unified CCC-EHTP-GDSP Diagnostics:** Three-stage autonomous neural health monitoring
    - Cohesion Check (fragmentation detection)
    - Emergent Hierarchical Topology Probe (pathology identification)
    - Global Directed Synaptic Plasticity (surgical repairs)

- **Connectome Analysis:** Dynamic connectivity topology validation for self-organizing neural networks with structural plasticity

- **REVGSP:** Resonance Enhanced Valence Gated Synaptic Plasticity
    - Phase-sensitive three-factor learning bridging local spike-timing with global reward signals

- **ADC System:** Active Domain Cartography
    - Entropy-driven functional territory mapping for emergent neural specialization

- **UTE/UTD Pipeline:** Universal Temporal Encoder/Decoder
    - Bidirectional spike pattern transduction for sensory input and actuator control

- **HSI Validation:** Homeostatic Stability Index
    - Real-time "cybernetic organism" health monitoring under perturbation stress testing

## Status

These discoveries have been validated internally as a unified "cybernetic organism", following patterns observed in organism adaptations over the course of their lifespan, specifically with regard to intelligence, stress resilience, and the idea of an ethical "conscience". Documentation and user-friendly validation content is currently being curated for public release.
