    """
    Creates a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) graph as a sparse matrix.
    This is a direct implementation of the subquadratic scaling principle.

    Instead of random connections, each neuron is connected only to its 'k'
    most similar neighbors, ensuring the network is both sparse and
    structurally intelligent from the start.

    Args:
        num_neurons (int): The total number of neurons in the network.
        k (int): The number of nearest neighbors to connect to.
        is_excitatory (np.ndarray): A boolean array indicating if a neuron is excitatory.
        feature_dim (int): The dimensionality of the feature space for neurons.

    Returns:
        lil_matrix: A sparse matrix representing the directed k-NN graph.
